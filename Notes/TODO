TODO NEXT:

	X update block snaps per tick to lerps
	X fix updates per tick to preserve before-tick states so that block
		evaluations are consistent
	X mark blocks that have had mutations so that only those have calculations
		done per evaluation tick
	X fix block placement against blocks that are translating or rotating
	X do block evaluation processes on an async coroutine, and the mutation
		commits sychronously
	X create encapsulation class (Block.cs) for block gameobjects and scripts	
	X update block evaluation from coroutine to multithread	
	X more caching of block gameobject components (solved by Block encapsulation class)
	- start menu (new game, load save, exit)
	- in-game options (save, load, exit)
	- ability to save game


GAMEPLAY TODO:

	X procedural generation of flat map (for testing)
	X placement and removal of blocks
	X walking mode for player
	X blocks of different types
	X player current selected block switching
	X block orientation:
		X ghost placement
		X contols for altering orientation of ghost block
		X place real block as same orientation as ghost block
		X fix block sensor system to work with new block rotations
	X block interaction with key 'F'
	X behavior for different block types:
		X move discrete spaces
		X rotate
		X on/off light
	X block-to-block interaction:
		X power block turns on light block
		X conveyor block moves block
	- UI:
		- start menu (new game, load save, exit)
		- in-game options (save, load, exit)
	- ability to save game
	- flying mode for player
	- player sprint mode
	- rendering optimizations


SYSTEMS TODO:

	X block types registry
	X player inventory (blocks available to player)
	X scene config
	X evaluations-per-tick (for block evaluations)
	- game save


REFACTORS TODO:

	X create encapsulation class for block gameobjects and scripts
	- (maybe) move ghost block instance inside player instance instead of global
		block manager or its own manager
	- (maybe) move EnvironmentGeneration.CreateBlock() method to BlockManager


CLEANUP/FIXES:

	X update block snaps per tick to lerps
	X fix updates per tick to preserve before-tick states so that block
		evaluations are consistent
	X fix block placement against blocks that are translating or rotating
	- fix jumping when in grounded mode
	- fix slowdown of player when not moving
	- fix camera pan jittering while moving
	- fix ghost block orientation control to be more intuitive


OPTIMIZATIONS:
	X mark blocks that have had mutations so that only those have calculations
		done per evaluation tick
	X do block evaluation processes on a coroutine, and the mutation commits
		sychronously
	X update block evaluation from coroutine to multithread
	X more caching of block gameobject components (solved by Block encapsulation class)
	- keep a secondary list of blocks that need evaluation/mutation commits done (maybe)


DEFER:

	- UI: inventory for selecting block types
