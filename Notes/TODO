TODO NEXT:

	X move player gameobject and scripts inside Player class
	X add player to scene at runtime with PlayerManager
	X add load game from start-menu
	X cleanup save and load systems
	X add more info to game-info UI:
		X total blocks in scene
	X move EnvironmentGeneration.CreateBlock() method to BlockManager
	X move GhostBlock inside PlayerInventory instead of BlockManager
	X fix block evaluations regarding movement to query move-to space for vacancy
	X fix blocks flush against each other visual bug
	X fix camera pan jittering while moving
	X fix slowdown of player when not moving
	X fix mouse hide/show
	X fix player move controls to be separated from block orientation control
	X fix jumping
	X dial-in player speed/movement
	X fix block removal async thread bug (fixed for now)
	X fix LightBlock transparency
	- fix ghost block orientation control to be more intuitive
	- fix 'playerCameraComponent' not found BUG in PlayerLookScript.Start()


GAMEPLAY TODO:

	X procedural generation of flat map (for testing)
	X placement and removal of blocks
	X walking mode for player
	X blocks of different types
	X player current selected block switching
	X block orientation:
		X ghost placement
		X contols for altering orientation of ghost block
		X place real block as same orientation as ghost block
		X fix block sensor system to work with new block rotations
	X block interaction with key 'F'
	X behavior for different block types:
		X move discrete spaces
		X rotate
		X on/off light
	X block-to-block interaction:
		X power block turns on light block
		X conveyor block moves block
	X UI:
		X start menu (new game, load save, exit)
		X in-game options (save, load, exit)
	X ability to save game
	X ability to load saved game
	- flying mode for player
	- player sprint mode


SYSTEMS TODO:

	X block types registry
	X player inventory (blocks available to player)
	X scene config
	X evaluations-per-tick (for block evaluations)
	X game save
	X game load


REFACTORS TODO:

	X create encapsulation class for block gameobjects and scripts
	X move player gameobject and scripts inside Player class
	X add player to scene at runtime with PlayerManager
	X move EnvironmentGeneration.CreateBlock() method to BlockManager
	X move GhostBlock inside PlayerInventory instead of BlockManager



CLEANUP/FIXES:

	X update block snaps per tick to lerps
	X fix updates per tick to preserve before-tick states so that block
		evaluations are consistent
	X fix block placement against blocks that are translating or rotating
	X fix removal of power block from light block (light block should turn off)
	X fix power block face down (doesn't power lower light block)
	X add load game from start-menu
	X cleanup save and load systems
	X add more info to game-info UI:
		X total blocks in scene
	X fix block evaluations regarding movement to query move-to space for vacancy
	X fix blocks flush against each other visual bug
	X fix camera pan jittering while moving
	X fix slowdown of player when not moving
	X fix mouse hide/show
	X fix player move controls to be separated from block orientation control
	X fix jumping
	X dial-in player speed/movement
	X fix block removal async thread bug (fixed for now)
	X fix LightBlock transparency
	- fix ghost block orientation control to be more intuitive
	- fix 'playerCameraComponent' not found BUG in PlayerLookScript.Start()


OPTIMIZATIONS:

	X mark blocks that have had mutations so that only those have calculations
		done per evaluation tick
	X do block evaluation processes on a coroutine, and the mutation commits
		sychronously
	X update block evaluation from coroutine to multithread
	X more caching of block gameobject components (solved by Block encapsulation class)
	- keep a secondary list of blocks that need evaluation/mutation commits done (maybe)


DEFER:

	- UI: inventory for selecting block types
