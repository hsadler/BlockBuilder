GAMEPLAY TODO:

    X procedural generation of flat map (for testing)
    X placement and removal of blocks
    X walking mode for player
    X blocks of different types
    X player current selected block switching
    X block orientation:
        X ghost placement
        X contols for altering orientation of ghost block
        X place real block as same orientation as ghost block
        X fix block sensor system to work with new block rotations
    X block interaction with key 'F'
    - behavior for different block types:
        - move discrete spaces
        - rotate
        - on/off light
    - block-to-block interaction:
        - power block turns on light block
        - conveyor block moves block
    - UI:
        - inventory for selecting block types
        - start menu (new game, load save, exit) 
        - in-game options (save, load, exit)
    - ability to save game
    - flying mode for player
    - player sprint mode
    - rendering optimizations


SYSTEMS TODO:

    X block types registry
    X player inventory (blocks available to player)


REFACTORS TODO:

    - (maybe) move ghost block instance inside player instance instead of global block manager
    - (maybe) move EnvironmentGeneration.CreateBlock() method to BlockManager


CLEANUP/FIXES:

    - fix jumping when in grounded mode
    - fix slowdown of player when not moving
    - fix camera pan jittering while moving
    - fix ghost block orientation control
