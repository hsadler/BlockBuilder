BLOCK UPDATE CONSISTENCY PROBLEM

problem:
	- block mutations happen during evaluation loop
	- if blocks mutate other blocks this can cause inconsistencies (already seen
		with position mutations)

solution:
	- use a block mutation struct to gather all block mutations
	- do a second "commit mutation" loop after each evalutation loop

possible problems:
	- a system for reserving block spaces may need to be implemented to prevent
		collisions of more than one block attempting to enter a vacant space
