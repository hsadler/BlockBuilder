GAME SAVE NOTES

problem:
	- game needs to be able to be saved and loaded

solution:
	- for save: serialize game data to json and write to file
	- for load: read json from save file and restore game data
	- game data to persist:
		- Player:
			- position
			- rotation
		- Block:
			- type
			- position
			- rotation
	- scene managers that need init on game load:
		- BlockManager
		- PlayerManager

implementation:
	- data types:
		- Vector3Struct { x:<int>, y:<int>, z:<int> }
		- PlayerStruct
			{
				type: <str>,
				position: <Vector3Struct>,
				rotation: <Vector3Struct>
			}
		- BlockStruct
			{
				position: <Vector3Struct>,
				rotation: <Vector3Struct>
			}
	- serializable GameSave object:
		{
			player: <PlayerStruct>
			blocks: <BlockStruct>[]
		}
